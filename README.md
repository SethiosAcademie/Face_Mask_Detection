# Face Mask Detection Using Tensorflow,Keras,Opencv & Python.

Masks play a crucial role in protecting the health of individuals against respiratory diseases, as is one of the few precautions available for COVID-19 in the absence of immunization. With this dataset, it is possible to create a model to detect people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing masks improperly.
This dataset contains 853 images belonging to the 3 classes, as well as their bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format.
The classes are:
